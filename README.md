# 🎬 **Initial Project Setup — LLMOps Celebrity Detector**

This branch establishes the foundational structure for the **LLMOps Celebrity Detector** project.
It sets up a clean, modular Python codebase, wiring in packaging via `setup.py` so that the `app` package (and its utilities) can be imported reliably from anywhere in the project.

This early foundation is aimed at supporting future work such as:

* Web-facing endpoints for uploading or describing media
* LLM-powered reasoning for celebrity identification and explanations
* Integration with external APIs and model providers
* CI/CD automation for testing and deployment

## 🗂️ **Project Structure**

Below is the current repository layout, listing all core files and directories.
For subpackages, all `__init__.py` files are shown explicitly. Only the **root** `README.md` is included.

## ⚙️ **Setup Process**

### 1️⃣ Create the Project Layout

The following high-level layout was created to keep application logic, utilities, and front-end assets clearly separated:

```bash
mkdir -p app/utils
mkdir -p static templates .circleci
touch app/__init__.py app/utils/__init__.py
```

* `app/` will host the main web application (for example, the future `app.py` entrypoint and route handlers).
* `app/utils/` will hold reusable helper functions and classes shared across the app.
* `static/` and `templates/` are reserved for the HTML/CSS/JS front end.

### 2️⃣ Enable Module Imports with `setup.py`

A minimal `setup.py` was added so that the project can be installed in **editable** mode.
This allows you to import `app` and `app.utils` from anywhere once the environment is activated:

```bash
uv pip install --editable .
```

Using editable installs ensures that changes to the source code are immediately reflected without reinstalling the package.

### 3️⃣ Create and Activate the Virtual Environment (uv)

The project uses **uv** to manage the virtual environment and locked dependencies.

Create the environment (Python 3.12, for example):

```bash
uv venv --python 3.12
```

Activate it:

**Windows (cmd)**

```cmd
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

**macOS / Linux**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 4️⃣ Install Dependencies

With the environment active, install the initial dependencies defined in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv lock
```

The `uv.lock` file pins exact versions, supporting reproducible environments across machines and CI.

### 5️⃣ Set Up Environment Variables (`.env`)

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
touch .env
```

For now, this file acts as a placeholder for future configuration (for example, API keys for LLM or vision providers).
As additional components are introduced (e.g., external model APIs, storage backends), the corresponding keys will be added here and loaded via your configuration layer.

## 🧩 **Integration Guidelines**

| Path               | Purpose                                                                     |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `app/`             | Main application package (future endpoints, orchestration, business logic). |
| `app/utils/`       | Helper utilities and shared logic reused across the app.                    |
| `static/`          | CSS, JavaScript, and image assets for the front end.                        |
| `templates/`       | HTML templates for rendering views/pages.                                   |
| `.circleci/`       | CI/CD workflows for automated tests and builds.                             |
| `pyproject.toml`   | Project metadata, build backend, and tool configuration.                    |
| `setup.py`         | Editable install and packaging configuration.                               |
| `requirements.txt` | List of Python dependencies for this project.                               |
| `.env`             | Environment variables (kept local and untracked).                           |

## ✅ **In Summary**

This initial setup provides a solid foundation for the **LLMOps Celebrity Detector** by:

* Defining a clear package structure (`app` and `app.utils`) ready for web and detection logic
* Enabling editable installs via `setup.py` for convenient imports during development
* Managing dependencies reproducibly with **uv** (`.venv`, `uv.lock`)
* Preparing CI (`.circleci/`), static assets, and templates for future UI and deployment work

From here, you can begin implementing the core celebrity detection logic inside `app/` and layer on web routes, templates, and CI workflows as the project evolves.
